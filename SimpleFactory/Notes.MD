# Simple Factory

**Goals:**
1. Simple factory hides instantiation logic from the client.
2, Factory is an object that creates other objects. 

**Example:**

I like to have a bowl of chocos every morning for breakfast. If I wanted to teach a robot to make this bowl for me everyday, I don't have to define each instruction as add chocos, add milk, etc. There are a predefined set of instructions I can have here to do this. 

Have a look at the code to see how a simple factory design pattern can be applied here.
